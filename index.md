# Data Description
There will be at least three datasets involved with my work: long-term count data, mark-recapture and physiological measurement data, and environmental data. The long-term count dataset is composed of observational survey data. The data are collected during fixed time period, unlimited detection radius, stationary point count surveys along previously established routes. During field surveys the observer records the location, start time, and who is conducting the count, in addition to each individual bird detected within survey duration, what species it is, the cardinal direction of detection, distance from observer to bird, during which subsections of time it was detected or not, and how it was detected. The mark-recapture and physiological measurement dataset will be composed of bird capture data and effort data. These data are gathered during netting sessions in which birds are safely captured, marked with a unique identifier (a metal leg band with a numeric combination), and numerous quantitative and qualitative measurements are taken. While mark-recapture analyses primarily depend on whether the bird was previously marked or not, bird banding can yield a multitude of other data types which can be used to address other ecological questions and are almost always collected. Those can include, but are not limited to, age, sex, weight, wing (or other body part) measurements, extent of feather molt, and qualitatively scored amount of fat, feather wear, and breeding characteristics. Effort data associated with bird banding sessions usually includes total number of nets, duration of operation, total number of birds captured, and personnel present. The environmental dataset will be composed of georeferenced observational data collected by environmental remote sensors. These sensors will be distributed across the study site and will record temperature, humidity, and dew point, among other variables.
I anticipate that the long-term count dataset will be largest (5-10 GB), followed by the mark-recapture and physiological measurement dataset (1-4 GB), and the environmental data  (~500 MB). 

# Roles and responsibilities
The graduate researcher is tasked with drafting and submitting the data management plan to the PI for review and any potential revisions, in addition to ensuring it is   followed. All data collection in Panama will be a joint effort by the graduate researcher, PI, and any other parties that may be involved. Other data collection, such as work with specimens and monitoring of environmental sensors will be the responsibility of the graduate researcher. The individuals to conduct field work or experiments that involve equipment will be responsible for any required maintenance and calibration. Following data collection, it is the responsibility of the graduate researcher to manage, organize, and ensure the quality of the data. Data entry of any hard copies of data sheets will fall to the graduate researcher. The PI and graduate research will both be responsible for archiving data in a data repository and analyzing or manipulating the data. In the case a primary researcher involved with the project leaves, the PI will take over any responsibility they had.
