Data management plan for the project physiological tollerance of birds to fragmentation in central Panama.

Context:

Barro Colorado Island (BCI), a forest fragment isolated by the construction of the Panama Canal in the early 1900s, has been nearly continually occupied by professional ornithologists who have studied its birds since the 1920s. Despite environmental protections, a lack of anthropogenic habitat disturbance or degradation, and relatively little change in local climate patterns, nearly 30% of forest bird species are now extinct from the island, all of which are present in mainland forests within just 20-30 kilometers. Since the 1990s, ornithologists have sought to tease out the drivers of BCIâ€™s high rate of extinction. Past research has included exploring dispersal ability, comparing island and mainland nest predation rates, and identifying trends between life history traits and local extinction probability. The research is focused on documenting and understanding change in the forest birds communities of BCI by combining the continuation of long-term point count surveys with investigations of physiological tolerance to fragmentation. From this work, we are trying to answer several questions: 1) are there physiological attributes that render some species less or more tolerant of the environmental impacts of fragmentation?; and, 2) do the thermoregulatory capabilities of forest birds differ, and if so, to what extent?
